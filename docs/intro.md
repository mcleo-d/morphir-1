# Morphir

## For the first time, business logic can be shared, stored, translated and visualised, all with the reliability of standardisation ensured in the Morphir framework

Morphir is a library of tools that works to capture business logic as data:

### What is it?

A set of tools for integrating technologies. Morphir is composed of a library of tools that facilitate the digitisation of business logic into multiple different languages & platforms. The Morphir framework is unique too in that facilities elements of automation and conversion that were previously unavailable in the field of finance-tech.

### Why is it important?

Makes business logic portable. Business logic digitised provides distinct advantages: capacity for movement across departments and fields & the ability to be converted to new languages and applications.

### How does it work?

Defines a standard format for storing and sharing business logic. A clear set of standards and format is in-place from the input/output, allowing for coherent structure.

### What are the benefits?

#### ✔️ Eliminates technical debt risk

> _Refactoring code libraries is often a harmful and time-sensitive issue for businesses, Morphir ensure the standards introduced from input eliminate delays at deployment._

#### ✔️ Increases agility

> _Adaptability and usability are key concepts of the Morphir framework, business logic can now move with the code, be easily understood and adopted, in an ever-developing eco-system._

#### ✔️ Ensures correctness

> _Certifying that specified functions behave as intended from input to output is assured through the Morphir library / tool chain._

#### ✔️ Disseminates information through automation

> _Morphir’s automated processing helps disseminate information which otherwise may not be understood or shared at all, a useful tool when brining elements of business logic to conversation outside of its immediate audience (i.e developers)._
