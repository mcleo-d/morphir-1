Morphir is composed of a library of tools that facilitate the digitisation of business logic into multiple different languages & platforms. The Morphir framework is unique too in that facilities elements of automation and conversion that were previously unavailable in the field of finance-tech.\\n\\n### Why is it important?\\n\\nMakes business logic portable. Business logic digitised provides distinct advantages: capacity for movement across departments and fields & the ability to be converted to new languages and applications.\\n\\n### How does it work?\\n\\nDefines a standard format for storing and sharing business logic. A clear set of standards and format is in-place from the input/output, allowing for coherent structure.\\n\\n### What are the benefits?\\n\\n#### \u2714\ufe0f Eliminates technical debt risk\\n\\n> _Refactoring code libraries is often a harmful and time-sensitive issue for businesses, Morphir ensure the standards introduced from input eliminate delays at deployment._\\n\\n#### \u2714\ufe0f Increases agility\\n\\n> _Adaptability and usability are key concepts of the Morphir framework, business logic can now move with the code, be easily understood and adopted, in an ever-developing eco-system._\\n\\n#### \u2714\ufe0f Ensures correctness\\n\\n> _Certifying that specified functions behave as intended from input to output is assured through the Morphir library / tool chain._\\n\\n#### \u2714\ufe0f Disseminates information through automation\\n\\n> _Morphir\u2019s automated processing helps disseminate information which otherwise may not be understood or shared at all, a useful tool when brining elements of business logic to conversation outside of its immediate audience (i.e developers)._\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n---\\n\\n[Morphir Resource Centre](https://morphir.zngly.com/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## An ecosystem of innovative features\\n\\nSupporting the development of your business\u2019 needs in an ever-developing ecosystem based on firm standards and the integration of new languages.\\n\\nCheck out **[GITHUB >>](https://github.com/stephengoldbaum/morphir-examples/tree/master/tutorial)**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\x3c!-- <br/>\\n\\n# Further Reading\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n| Introduction & Background                                          | Using Morphir                                                                                              | Applicability                                                                 |\\n| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| [Resource Centre](https://morphir.zngly.com/)                      | [What Makes a Good Model](what-makes-a-good-domain-model)                                                  | [Sharing Business Logic Across Application Boundaries](shared_logic_modeling) |\\n| [Background](background)                                           | [Development Automation (Dev Bots)](dev_bots)                                                              | [Regulatory Technology](regtech_modeling)                                     |\\n| [Community](morphir_community)                                     | [Modeling an Application](application_modeling)                                                            |                                                                               |\\n| [What\'s it all about?](whats_it_about)                             | [Modeling Decision Tables](https://github.com/finos/morphir-examples/tree/master/src/Morphir/Sample/Rules) |                                                                               |\\n| [Working Across Technologies](work_across_languages_and_platforms) | [Modeling for database developers](modeling/modeling-for-database-developers.md)                           |                                                                               |\\n| [Why we use Functional Programming?](why_functional_programming)   |                                                                                                            |                                                                               | --\x3e"}]}')}}]);
