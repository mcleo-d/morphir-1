# Morphir

For the first time, business logic can be shared, stored, translated and visualised, all with the reliability of standardisation ensured in the Morphir framework.

---

Morphir is a library of tools that works to capture business logic as data:

## What is it?

A set of tools for integrating technologies. Morphir is composed of a library of tools that facilitate the digitisation of business logic into multiple different languages & platforms. The Morphir framework is unique too in that facilities elements of automation and conversion that were previously unavailable in the field of finance-tech.

## Why is it important?

Makes business logic portable. Business logic digitised provides distinct advantages: capacity for movement across departments and fields & the ability to be converted to new languages and applications.

## How does it work?

Defines a standard format for storing and sharing business logic. A clear set of standards and format is in-place from the input/output, allowing for coherent structure.

## What are the benefits?

### ✔️ Eliminates technical debt risk

> _Refactoring code libraries is often a harmful and time-sensitive issue for businesses, Morphir ensure the standards introduced from input eliminate delays at deployment._

### ✔️ Increases agility

> _Adaptability and usability are key concepts of the Morphir framework, business logic can now move with the code, be easily understood and adopted, in an ever-developing eco-system._

### ✔️ Ensures correctness

> _Certifying that specified functions behave as intended from input to output is assured through the Morphir library / tool chain._

### ✔️ Disseminates information through automation

> _Morphir’s automated processing helps disseminate information which otherwise may not be understood or shared at all, a useful tool when brining elements of business logic to conversation outside of its immediate audience (i.e developers)._

# Development setup

Morphir is a collection of tools. Each tool is in its own repo with its own installation instructions. The main development tools, and the best place to get started, are currently in [Morphir Elm](https://github.com/finos/morphir-elm).

## Usage example

Morphir tools can be used to optimize a wide range of development tasks. For example, Morphir can be used to define and automated development of an entire service. The [Morphir Dapr](https://github.com/finos/morphir-dapr) project is example of this.

Another good use of Morphir is to define shared rules than can be used across heterogeneous systems. This can be useful for initiatives like open-source Reg Tech models that are shared across firms. [Morphir LCR](https://github.com/finos/morphir-examples/tree/master/src/Morphir/Sample/LCR) presents a good example of this.

More Morphir examples can be found at [Morphir Examples](https://github.com/finos/morphir-examples/).
